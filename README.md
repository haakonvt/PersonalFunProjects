# Readme if you want

These are some short programs written in times of boredom.

# List:
1. Numerical solution to "travelling ants in corner of unit cube"-problem. Play around with the dt-parameter
2. A lot of experimenting along with classical solvers for the travelling salesman problem. Uncomment whichever solvers you want to try out, and play around with their parameters. Can you find a better solution than me to the N=24 cities (12287.07)?
3. A tic-tac-toe-game for your terminal window. AI is ok smart, but can be beaten! Kidding, its perfect.
4. NxM grid 5-in-a-row game for terminal. AI is still pretty bad.
