# Readme if you want

These are some short programs written in times of boredom.

# List:
1. Numerical solution to "travelling ants in corner of unit cube"-problem. Play around with the dt-parameter
2. A lot of experimenting along with classical solvers for the travelling salesman problem. Uncomment whichever solvers you want to try out, and play around with their parameters. Can you find a better solution than me to the N=24 cities (12287.07)?
3. A tic-tac-toe-game for your terminal window. AI is ok smart, but can be beaten! Kidding, its perfect.
4. NxM grid 5-in-a-row game for terminal. User can choose between different levels of AI. Best one, quite decent (deep search with miniMax).
5. Code for grabbing, storing and plotting financial information from Nordnet (regarding mine/your own portfolio) for any period of time. Run python getTodaysData.py, then python portfolioNordnet.py -update
